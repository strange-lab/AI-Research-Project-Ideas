# Graph Theory Related Projects
This folder will contain all projects related to graph theory and we will learn how to apply graph theory into different domains like `DSP` ,`NLP` , `Computer Vision` and other `AI` tasks. 

## 1. Sentence Similarity Using Graph Edit Distance
Represent sentences as graphs where nodes are words and edges represent relationships (e.g., syntactic dependencies). Compute similarity between two sentences using graph edit distance.

**Dataset** : Use small corpora like SNLI or GLUE .
**Why Start Here?** : Introduces basic graph representations and similarity metrics.

## 2. Knowledge Graph Construction from Small Text Corpora
Extract entities and relationships from text to build a simple knowledge graph. Use rule-based approaches or lightweight parsers like SpaCy.

**Dataset** : Use public datasets like WikiData or scrape small Wikipedia articles.
**Why Start Here?** : Helps understand how text can be transformed into structured graph data.

## 3. Text Summarization Using Graph-Centric Sentence Ranking
Represent a document as a graph where nodes are sentences and edges represent semantic similarity. Rank sentences using PageRank or similar algorithms to generate summaries.
**Dataset :** Use small news article datasets like CNN/DailyMail or Opinosis .
**Why Start Here? :** Introduces graph-based ranking techniques for summarization.

## 4. Cross-Lingual Word Alignment via Bipartite Graph Matching
Create a bipartite graph where nodes represent words in two languages, and edges represent alignment scores. Use matching algorithms to align words across languages.
**Dataset :** Use parallel corpora like Europarl or Tatoeba .
**Why Start Here? :** Explores graph-based methods for multilingual tasks.

## 5. Relation Extraction from Short Texts Using Graph Patterns
Model short texts (e.g., tweets) as graphs and extract relations between entities using predefined graph patterns.
**Dataset :** Use datasets like SemEval 2010 Task 8 .
**Why Start Here? :** Focuses on extracting structured information from unstructured text.

## 6. Graph-Based Paraphrase Detection Without Pretraining
Represent paraphrases as graphs and compare them using graph similarity measures like Jaccard similarity or graph kernels.
**Dataset :** Use datasets like Quora Question Pairs or PAWS .
**Why Start Here? :** Introduces graph-based similarity for paraphrase detection.
